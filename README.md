# Found A Bug?

**Report it in less than 5 minutes!**

FoundABug makes reporting bugs in desktop FOSS apps easy and quick.

Bug reporting no longer involves first spending 10 minutes registering for yet another bugtracker: FoundABug automates the entire process.

**I would like major distros and desktop environments to include it by default and bind it to (say) <kbd>Super-B</kbd>, so that a user can report bugs on most Linux installs with a simple keypress.**
